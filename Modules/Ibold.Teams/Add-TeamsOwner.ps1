.SYNOPSIS
    Adds a specified user (or list of users) as owner to all public Microsoft Teams, with optional support for private teams.

.DESCRIPTION
    Connects to Microsoft Teams, loops through all teams, and adds each user as an owner to public teams. Optionally includes private teams.
    Supports WhatIf dry-run mode and logs actions to a CSV on the user's desktop.

.PARAMETER UserPrincipalName
    The UPN (email) of a single user to be added as owner.

.PARAMETER UserListPath
    Path to a text file containing one UPN per line. Used for batch processing.

.PARAMETER Private
    If specified, the script includes private teams.

.PARAMETER ConfirmPrivate
    If $true, the script skips prompting for each private team. If $false (default), prompts for confirmation on each private team.

.PARAMETER WhatIf
    Simulates the operation without making changes.

.EXAMPLE
    Add-TeamsOwner -UserListPath ".\users.txt" -Private -Confirm:$true -WhatIf

.NOTES
    Requires MicrosoftTeams module.
